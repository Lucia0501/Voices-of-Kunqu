## Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive monitoring and observability for the Voices of Kunqu platform - a critical cultural educational system that bridges traditional Chinese Kunqu opera with British audiences through AI-powered technology. Monitoring focuses on cultural content authenticity, educational effectiveness, and technical excellence.

**Critical Business Context:**
- Cultural content must maintain 99.9% authenticity and accuracy
- Educational pathways require real-time progress tracking
- OpenAI TTS integration needs cost and performance monitoring
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance must be continuously validated
- User cultural learning progression demands detailed analytics
