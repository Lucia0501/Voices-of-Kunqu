## Executive Summary

This document defines Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the Voices of Kunqu platform, focusing on maintaining high reliability for cultural education while preserving cultural authenticity and accessibility. SLOs are aligned with business objectives of providing accessible cultural education to British audiences while maintaining the integrity of traditional Kunqu opera.

**Strategic Context:**
- Cultural content accuracy is mission-critical - zero tolerance for cultural misrepresentation
- Educational effectiveness requires consistent, reliable access to learning materials
- Accessibility compliance is legally mandated and morally essential
- Cost efficiency is crucial for non-profit sustainability
